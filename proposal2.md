# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Desktop Fishing Simulator 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that lets you catch a random assortment of fish in your free time

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The overall goal of the program is to use a random number generator that catch different type of fishes. Each time you catch a fish, the game tells you what type of fish you caught. Hopefully with the use of dictionaries there can be a glossary created for varieties of fishes. Including the varieties of trash collected throughout the game. Additionally, I also wanted to add more choices on what the player can do with the items in the game. Rather than just catching it and checking out the glossary, maybe with the use of if statements the player also has a choice whether to keep or chuck it back into the ocean. Depending on if the item is good or bad for the environment The game will tell you whether you messed up and killed the entire ecosystem or you saved it one fish/trash at a time. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The core function of the game, reeling in a fish and having a glossary feature that desribes the fish. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding in other probabilities of reeling in other miscelaneous objects besides fishes would make the game more enjoyable. Maybe instead of just reeling in fish alone, there's a chance to get trash or a fishing fine for catching an endangered spieces. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A system that allows you to make choices with the items you caught and based on your input, it will tell you how you affected the environment. Something better to add to the game would be a shop or upgrade feature if time allows it. In a more gamer fashion, reeling in power upgrades or a life system because there's chances you could also reel in a dangerous item like a pufferfish or seamine.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Topics that will need further research is dictionaries in general because it plays a big role in the game itself. I would like to solidify my foundations in random number generators and the probabilites behind it, as well as pulling information from dicitonaries. Additional research on the game dialogue selection might also be needed. Hopefully the game can also have an interface, I would like to do further research on how to design a working interface thats interacts with the player or maybe music as an additional bonus because it will enhance the player experience.
